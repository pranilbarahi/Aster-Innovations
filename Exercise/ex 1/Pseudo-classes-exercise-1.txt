Exercise 1: Interactive Buttons
HTML: Create a simple HTML page with three button elements.
CSS:
Style the buttons with a default background color and text color.
Use the :hover pseudo-class to change the background color and text color when the mouse pointer is over a button.
Use the :active pseudo-class to change the background color and text color when a button is clicked (held down).
Use the :focus pseudo-class to add a distinct outline or border when a button is focused (e.g., by tabbing through elements).


Exercise 2: Styling Links
HTML:
Create an HTML page with several <a> (anchor) elements, some of which link to real URLs and some that are just placeholders.
CSS:
Use :link to style unvisited links (e.g., blue text).
Use :visited to style visited links (e.g., purple text).
Use :hover to change the text color and add an underline when hovering over a link.
Use :active to change the link color when it's being clicked.


Exercise 3: List Styling with Structural Pseudo-classes
HTML: Create an unordered list (<ul>) with at least five list items (<li>).
CSS:
Use :first-child to style the first list item differently (e.g., bold text, different background color).
Use :last-child to style the last list item differently (e.g., italic text, different background color).
Use :nth-child(odd) to style all odd-numbered list items (e.g., a light gray background).
Use :nth-child(even) to style all even-numbered list items (e.g., a slightly darker gray background).


Exercise 4: Form Element Styling
HTML:
Create a simple HTML form with various input types: text input, checkbox, radio buttons, and a submit button.
CSS:
Use :focus to highlight the currently focused input field with a border or shadow.
Use :checked to style selected checkboxes and radio buttons (e.g., change the color of the label or add an outline to the input).
Use :disabled to style a disabled input field (e.g., grayed-out text, lighter background).
Exercise 5: Conditional Display with :has() (Advanced)
HTML: Create a div containing a heading (<h2>) and a paragraph (<p>).
CSS: Use the :has() pseudo-class to apply a style to the div only if it contains a p element immediately following an h2 element. For example, change the div's background color in this scenario.
